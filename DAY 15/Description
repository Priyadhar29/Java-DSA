Day 15: Binary Search in 2D Arrays
In my ongoing Java learning journey, I have explored Binary Search in 2D Arrays. This section covers the techniques for searching in matrices, particularly focusing on sorted matrices.

Key Concepts
Searching in a Matrix: Treating a 2D array as a 1D array to perform Binary Search.
Searching in a Sorted Matrix: Utilizing the sorted property of the matrix to efficiently find target elements by applying Binary Search to both rows and columns.
Problems Solved
To reinforce my understanding, I tackled several problems on GeeksforGeeks and LeetCode:

Row with Max 1s (GeeksforGeeks): Find the row with the maximum number of 1s in a binary matrix.
240. Search a 2D Matrix II (LeetCode): Search for a target element in a sorted 2D matrix.
74. Search a 2D Matrix (LeetCode): Another problem focused on searching for a target element in a sorted 2D matrix.

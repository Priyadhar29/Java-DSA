Day 16: Sorting Algorithms - Bubble Sort
Continuing my Java learning journey, I delved into Sorting Algorithms, focusing on Bubble Sort. This section covers the mechanics, time complexities, and characteristics of Bubble Sort.

Key Concepts
Bubble Sort: A straightforward sorting algorithm that compares adjacent elements and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.

Time Complexities:

Best Case: O(n)
Worst Case: O(nÂ²)
Space Complexity: O(1) - In-place sorting.

Stable vs. Unstable Sorting:

Stable Sorting: Maintains the order of equal elements (Bubble Sort).
Unstable Sorting: Does not guarantee the order of equal elements.
Practical Implementation
I implemented Bubble Sort and solved related problems on GeeksforGeeks to reinforce my understanding.

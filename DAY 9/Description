Singleton Class: A Singleton class is a class that can have only one instance, and provides a global point of access to that instance. 
It's useful when we need to control the instantiation of a class, and ensure that only one object is created. 

OOPS Concepts: I also learned about the principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOPS), including:

Inheritance: A mechanism that allows one class to inherit the properties and behavior of another class. 👪
Super and This Keywords: super is used to access the parent class, while this is used to access the current object. 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦

📈Code Updates: I've updated the repository with the following code examples:

Animal and Dog classes demonstrating the use of super keyword in Inheritance
Dog class example showcasing the use of this keyword to access instance variables

EXAMPLE:

class Person{
    String name;
    Person(String name){
        this.name = name;
        System.out.println("Person " + this.name);
    }
}

class employee extends Person{
    employee(String name){
        super(name);
        System.out.println("Employee " + super.name);
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String args[]){
        employee e1 = new employee("Priya");
        System.out.println(e1.name);
   }
}

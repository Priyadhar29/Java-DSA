Day 8: Garbage Collection, Finalize, Packages, and Static Members in Java
Welcome to Day 8 of my Java learning journey! ðŸŽ‰

Garbage Collection
Learned about Java's garbage collection mechanism and how it helps with memory management
Explored the different types of garbage collection in Java, including mark-and-sweep and generational garbage collection
The finalize() Method
Discovered the role of the finalize() method in object destruction
Learned about the importance of overriding the finalize() method in certain situations
Packages and Import Statements
Explored the concept of packages in Java and how they're used to organize classes and interfaces
Learned about the import statement and how it's used to import classes and interfaces from other packages
Static and Non-Static Members
Learned about the differences between static and non-static members in Java
Explored how to access static and non-static members, including static variables and methods
Discovered how to use static members inside non-static methods and vice versa
Initialization of Static Variables
Learned about the initialization of static variables in Java, including the order of initialization
Explored how to use static blocks to initialize static variables
Inner Classes
Discovered the concept of inner classes in Java and how they're used to create nested classes
Learned about the different types of inner classes, including static and non-static inner classes
Code Examples
Check out my code examples for Day 8, including a demonstration of garbage collection, a class that overrides the finalize() method, a package example, and a class that showcases the use of static and non-static members.

What's Next?
Stay tuned for more updates as I continue my Java learning journey! ðŸ’»ðŸ’¸

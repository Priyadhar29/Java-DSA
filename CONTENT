                                                            Welcome to my Java learning journey! ðŸš€ðŸ’»

In this repository, I'll be documenting my progress as I learn Java programming. Each day, I'll be posting a new update, covering a specific topic or concept.

         Day 1: Setting Up Java and Basic Syntax
Set up Java Development Kit (JDK) and Eclipse IDE
Learned basic syntax, including variables, data types, and operators
Created a simple "Hello, World!" program

        Day 2: Understanding Variables, Data Types, and Operators
Explored variables, data types, and operators in Java
Learned about primitive data types (e.g., int, double, boolean) and reference data types (e.g., classes, arrays, interfaces)
Created a program to demonstrate variable declaration, data types, and operator usage

        Day 3: Understanding Variables, Data Types, and Operators (continued)
Continued exploring variables, data types, and operators in Java
Learned about arithmetic, comparison, logical, and assignment operators
Created a program to demonstrate operator usage and variable manipulation

        Day 4: Control Flow Statements - If-Else Statements and Switch Statements
Learned about control flow statements in Java, including if-else statements and switch statements
Created programs to demonstrate if-else statement and switch statement usage
  
        Day 5: Methods in Java
Learned about methods in Java, including method declaration, method calls, and method overloading
Created a program to demonstrate method usage and method overloading

What's Next?
Stay tuned for more updates as I continue my Java learning journey! ðŸš€ðŸ’»

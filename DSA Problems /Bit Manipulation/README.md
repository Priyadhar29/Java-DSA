# 🔧 Bit Manipulation – Java DSA Problems

This folder contains a collection of Java programs that solve **Bit Manipulation** problems commonly found in competitive programming, technical interviews, and DSA practice.

## 📂 Folder Structure

Each `.java` file in this directory represents a different problem or concept related to bit manipulation. The logic is implemented in clean, readable Java code with `main()` methods to run test cases directly.

##🧠 Core Bit Tricks

| Expression      | Meaning                        |                   |
| --------------- | ------------------------------ | ----------------- |
| `x & 1`         | Checks if number is odd        |                   |
| `x >> 1`        | Divides `x` by 2               |                   |
| `x << 1`        | Multiplies `x` by 2            |                   |
| `x & (x - 1)`   | Removes the rightmost set bit  |                   |
| \`x             | (1 << i)\`                     | Sets the i-th bit |
| `x & ~(1 << i)` | Clears the i-th bit            |                   |
| `x ^ (1 << i)`  | Toggles the i-th bit           |                   |
| `(x >> i) & 1`  | Gets the value of the i-th bit |                   |

# 🔧 Bit Manipulation – Java DSA Problems

This folder contains a collection of Java programs that solve **Bit Manipulation** problems commonly found in competitive programming, technical interviews, and DSA practice.

---

## 📂 Folder Structure

Each `.java` file in this directory represents a different problem or concept related to bit manipulation. The logic is implemented in clean, readable Java code with `main()` methods to run test cases directly.

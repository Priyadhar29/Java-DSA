Constraints
0 ≤ k ≤ 30

Code:

import java.util.Scanner;

class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
    int a = sc.nextInt();       // Read first integer
    int b = sc.nextInt();       // Read second integer

    int xor = a ^ b;            // XOR a and b
    System.out.print(Integer.bitCount(xor));  // Count and print number of 1s in XOR
  }
}

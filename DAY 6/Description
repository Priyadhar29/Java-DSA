Day 6: Classes, Objects, and Constructors in Java
Welcome to Day 6 of my Java learning journey! ðŸŽ‰

Classes and Objects
Learned about class and object basics, including how to declare classes and create objects
Explored the concept of classes as blueprints for objects
Constructors
Learned about default constructors, constructor overloading, and calling a constructor from another constructor
Discovered how constructors are used to initialize objects
The this Keyword
Explored the uses of the this keyword in Java, including referencing the current object and distinguishing between instance variables and method parameters
Code Examples
Check out my code examples for Day 6, including a simple class with a default constructor, a class with constructor overloading, and a class that demonstrates the use of the this keyword.

What's Next?
Stay tuned for more updates as I continue my Java learning journey! ðŸš€ðŸ’»

"Excited to Share My GitHub Repository on Binary Search! ðŸš€"

As part of my Java learning journey, I've been diving deep into Binary Search and its applications. I've compiled my notes, examples, and explanations into a GitHub repository for anyone interested in enhancing their understanding of this powerful algorithm.

What You'll Find:

Detailed explanations of Binary Search and its efficiency
A safer method for finding the mid-point to avoid overflow
Order Agnostic Binary Search techniques
Practical examples and use cases

A special thanks to Kunal Kushwaha for his invaluable resources that helped me grasp these concepts!

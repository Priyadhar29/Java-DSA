# 🗺️ Maps - Java DSA Practice Problems

This folder contains a collection of Java practice problems based on **Maps** (such as `HashMap`, `TreeMap`, and `LinkedHashMap`) as part of Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) in Java.

These problems help in understanding the working of Map-based data structures and their applications in real-world and interview scenarios.

## 📌 Topics Covered

- Frequency counting (characters, words, numbers)
- Duplicate detection
- Finding first unique/non-repeating elements
- Sorting elements using Map
- Anagram problems using Maps
- Key-value manipulation techniques

## 💻 Technologies Used

- Programming Language: Java
- Concepts: Java Collections Framework – `Map`, `HashMap`, `TreeMap`, `LinkedHashMap`
- IDE: IntelliJ / Eclipse / VS Code

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Priyadhar29/Java-DSA.git
2. Navigate to this folder:

   cd Java-DSA/Practice\ Problems/Maps

📚 Sample Use-Cases
Count the frequency of characters in a string.

Find the first non-repeating character.

Detect if two strings are anagrams.

Count occurrences of elements in an array.

Sort map entries by key or value.

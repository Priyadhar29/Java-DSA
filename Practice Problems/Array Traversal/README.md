# Array Traversal â€“ Java DSA Practice

This folder contains Java-based practice problems related to **Array Traversal**, a fundamental concept in Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA). Array traversal involves accessing each element of an array to perform operations such as searching, updating, or displaying elements.

## ðŸ“š Topics Covered

The problems in this directory help you build a strong foundation in array handling and traversing. Topics include:

- Basic traversal (forward and backward)
- Conditional traversal (e.g., even/odd, negative/positive)
- Reverse printing
- Sum and average calculation
- Element comparison and filtering
- Index-based operations

## ðŸ§  Problem List

| Problem | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `ReverseArray.java` | Print the array elements in reverse order |
| `PrintEvenIndex.java` | Print elements present at even indices |
| `PrintOddElements.java` | Print only odd numbers from the array |
| `SumOfArray.java` | Compute the sum of all array elements |
| `FindMaxMin.java` | Find the maximum and minimum elements in the array |
| `PrintPositive.java` | Print only positive integers from the array |
| `PrintNegative.java` | Print only negative integers from the array |

> âœ… All problems are implemented in **Java** with a focus on clarity and core logic.

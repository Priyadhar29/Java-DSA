# Java DSA: Loop-Based Practice Problems

This folder contains a collection of Java practice problems that focus on **loops** – an essential programming construct for iteration and control flow. The problems are designed to strengthen your understanding of `for`, `while`, and `do-while` loops through hands-on coding examples.

## 🧠 Topics Covered

- Basic usage of `for`, `while`, and `do-while` loops
- Nested loops
- Pattern printing
- Summation and series
- Factorials and number properties
- Palindrome checks
- Prime number logic
- Multiplication tables
- Reverse numbers and digits

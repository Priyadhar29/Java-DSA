Day 11: Unpacking Encapsulation, Abstraction, and Interfaces in OOP 📚💻

Today, I delved into the fascinating world of encapsulation, abstraction, and interfaces in object-oriented programming (OOP) 🤯. These fundamental concepts are crucial in designing robust, modular, and scalable software systems 💪.

Encapsulation 🔒

Encapsulation is the concept of bundling data and methods that operate on that data within a single unit, called a class 📦. This helps to:

Hide internal implementation details from the outside world 🤫
Protect data from external interference and misuse 🚫
Improve code organization and readability 📖
Abstraction 🔮

Abstraction is the practice of exposing only essential features of an object while hiding its internal complexities 🔍. This enables:

Simplified interactions with complex systems 📈
Improved modularity and reusability of code 📦
Easier maintenance and updates 💻
Getters and Setters 🔑

Getters and setters are special methods that allow controlled access to an object's properties 🔓. They provide a way to:

Validate input data 📝
Perform additional logic before setting or retrieving data 💡
Maintain data integrity and consistency 💯
Abstract Classes and Interfaces 📋

Abstract classes and interfaces define blueprints for other classes to follow 📝. They provide a way to:

Define a common set of methods and properties for related classes 👥
Establish a contract that must be implemented by derived classes 📝
Promote code reuse and polymorphism 🔁
Interfaces 📝

Interfaces are abstract classes that contain only method declarations, without any implementation 📝. They are used to:

Define a set of methods that must be implemented by derived classes 👉
Establish a contract for other classes to follow 📝
Promote loose coupling and polymorphism 🔁
I also solved several problems on GeeksforGeeks (GFG) to reinforce my understanding of these concepts 💪. It's been a productive day, and I'm excited to apply these concepts to real-world projects 🚀!
